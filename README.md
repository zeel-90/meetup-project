# React Meetups – Next.js Project

A modern, full-featured application built with Next.js and MongoDB that enables users to browse, add, and manage meetups. This project demonstrates advanced concepts like dynamic routing, static site generation (SSG), and modular component design for a robust, production-like web app experience.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dynamic Routing:**  
  Each meetup has a dedicated detail page powered by dynamic Next.js routes.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):**  
  Uses `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for lightning-fast, SEO-friendly pages with data fetched at build time.

- **Full MongoDB Integration:**  
  Stores and manages all meetup data in a MongoDB database. All CRUD operations are handled securely on the backend.

- **Modular React Components:**  
  Clean, maintainable UI using reusable React components throughout the app.

- **API Routes:**  
  Secure creation of new meetups via Next.js API routes and forms.
